# README

Welcome to Peeker! We are out to solve the age old problem of lying to potential significant others. We use Clarifai technology to analyze photos to interpret who users really are and match them with other users.

Users are able to:
+ upload pictures
+ select from a list of preferences (represented as photos)
+ like other users
+ get matched!

To learn more about Clarifai: https://www.clarifai.com/

## Setup

Before you begin, fork and clone this repo, run `bundle install` and `rake db:migrate` to get started.


##What you need to use Peeker:

* System dependencies: You will need to upload local photos that will be analyzed to perform the matching magic.  

* Database creation- for testing purposes, we have included some seed data!
run `rake db:seed`.
